# More Python exercise

## Ex00 - Map, filter, reduce

Implement the higher order functions map(), filter() and reduce(). Take the time to understand the use
cases of these three built-in functions.

__For this exercise I decided to implement a class for map and filter__

## Ex01 - args and kwargs?

Implement the what_are_the_vars function that returns an object with the right attributes.
You will have to modify the “instance” ObjectC, NOT THE CLASS.
Have a look to getattr, setattr.

## Ex02 - The logger

In this exercise, we want you to learn about decorators, and we are not talking about the decoration of your
room.
The @log will write info about the decorated function in a machine.log file.
